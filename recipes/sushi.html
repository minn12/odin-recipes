                <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
                
                <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
                
                <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
                
                <li>½ pound imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>
                
                <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
                
                <li>½ cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips</li>
                
                <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, 
            and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>

            <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. 
            Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>

            <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>

            <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>

            <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer 
            of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger 
            over rice in a line down the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly 
            over filling to make a complete roll.</li> 
            
            <li>Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>

            <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
         </ol>
